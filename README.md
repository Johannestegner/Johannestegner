## Hi!

Hi there! I'm Johannes, and I like code!

Other than code (and none github related stuff like family and such) I really enjoy working with containerization and cloud native tech.
I run my own company ([Jitesoft AB](https://github.com/jitesoft)) in which I work with consulting and FOSS.

So what I have done through the years?
In short:

* I've dreamt about programming since the age of 5
* I've studied programming
* I've worked with programming since 2009

If you would prefer to se a more detailed description of my career, feel free to checkout out my [CV](https://jite.eu/CV) on my personal [blog](https://jite.eu)!

Most repositories I work with are under my organization scope: https://github.com/jitesoft, while you are totally welcome to check out all my... older... repositories
and any fork I have under this account!
